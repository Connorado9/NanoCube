The NanoCube Arduino Code

This LED cube will adapt to its surroundings by adjusting to ambient temperatures, light intensities, and human presence. A motion detector recognizes if a user is in the room to turn the device on or off (in addition to a physical button). A photoresistor detects ambient lighting and sets the cube’s brightness accordingly. Lastly, a temperature sensor adjusts the cube’s hue to mimic surrounding temperatures via color. 

Sparkfun LEDs were programmed to cycle through colors and display the room's temperature.
